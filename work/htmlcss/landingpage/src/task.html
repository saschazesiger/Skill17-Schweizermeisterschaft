                        Some people do more for humanity. Us, the People of the Year foundation, have hand-picked the ones we think have done one small step for themselves and a giant leap for us all and are providing them with the platform they deserve to be seen on.

                    <h3>First selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        It all started eight months ago when Brandon started up a new <a href="#">Tinkerwell</a> session,
                        copied in all the names of the people in this world we could find online and ran
                        <code>Arr::random()</code> on them. A bunch of times. 152 times to be exact.
                        75 hours later we had a list of candidates that we wanted to consider for these awards.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Second selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        We do not have a limit to how many people are awarded each year so we knew every
                        candidate could possibly deserve an award. Just to make sure <code>Arr::random()</code>
                        did not just spit out random names but rather worthy candidates we briefly skimmed over
                        the list and decided two of the candidates were a mistake.
                        One of them found a way to use nuclear fusion on a large scale but never actually went to school
                        and the other lived in a forest which we think does not make them deserve an award.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Third selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        The remaining 270 hours were spent with 50 other judges who, among the
                        150 candidates left, tried to find the chosen ones. That ones that had
                        done more this year. The ones that had gone above and beyond not only
                        in their own field but in ways that help humanity take one or more leaps
                        towards a brighter future.

                    <h3>No-go criteria</h3>
                    <p>
                        When skimming over the carefully chosen list of candidates we had to make a strict set of rules
                        to quickly decide which of the candidates do not belong on this platform. The following are the
                        rules copied right from our notebook so you can get a glimpse at how we work. Anyone who matches
                        one of these criteria is excluded from the list immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People who...
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>...own more than seven pets.</li>
                        <li>...drink more than four times a week.</li>
                        <li>...have been to every continent.</li>
                        <li>...like pinapple.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We were trying to be more open but we could not let every randomly selected person
                        get through to the next round so we had to make some strict decisions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Award night</h3>
                    <p>
                        We will be organising an award night in the coming weeks.
                        Not only will there be a lot of food but there will be disco lights as well.
                        Every candidate will be invited to join our amazing party. All other tickets
                        can be bought on our other website for CHF 1'499.-.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are looking forward to meeting you there and would like you to join us
                        in appreciating the work the awarded people have done for us all.
                    </p>
