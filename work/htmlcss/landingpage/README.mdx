# Task 2 - Building a landing page

Your second task is to understand the existing resources and finish the work of creating the layout of several components that make up a landing page in pure HTML and CSS.

For this task, the designer has provided you some UI designs and specifications:

- Hero component
  - [Desktop](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/hero-final-desktop.jpg)
  - [Mobile](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/hero-final-mobile.jpg)
- Facts component
  - [Desktop](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/facts-final-desktop.jpg)
  - [Mobile](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/facts-final-mobile.jpg)
- People component
  - [Desktop](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/people-final-desktop.jpg)
  - [Mobile](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/people-final-mobile.jpg)
- Text component
  - [Desktop 1](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/text-final-desktop-1.jpg)
  - [Desktop 2](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/text-final-desktop-2.jpg)
  - [Mobile 1](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/material/text-final-mobile-1.jpg)

## Responsive

Every component should be styled mobile-first for at least two window sizes:

- Mobile (up to 768px)
- Desktop (starting at 768px)

**All required image assets are provided in `src/assets`**

## HTML and CSS files

Feel free to modify and extend the **CSS** code to your needs.

You can also extend the **HTML** code by adding new attributes or elements,
but make sure you **don't delete** existing elements and attributes.
Otherwise, the tests we will use for scoring may fail.

Use the HTML and CSS files provided in the `work/htmlcss/landingpage/src` folder.
**Do not create or modify any files outside of this directory for this task.**

| Description | File                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML file   | [src/task.html](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/src/task.html) |
| CSS file    | [src/task.css](http://localhost/work/htmlcss/landingpage/src/task.css)   |

  * The use of JavaScript is not allowed. <br />

## Scoring

For scoring, we will use automated End-to-End tests to verify that the functionality works as expected.
You can also run the same tests that we will use to verify your score.

To run the tests, open a terminal and `cd` into the `work/htmlcss/landingpage` directory.
Then, execute the following command in your terminal:

- `npm run start`
- wait for cypress to start (it might take a bit of time initially)
- select the desired `{component}.test.js`-testsuite
- a chrome window will open and the tests will run
- click the "Run all tests"-Button or reload the page to rerun the test
- select or hover over a test or assertion in the left sidebar to see the HTML at that specific point in time
