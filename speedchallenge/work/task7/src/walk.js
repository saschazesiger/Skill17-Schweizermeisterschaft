 */

/**
 * Robot dogs only have battery capacity to walk a
 * certain number of meters. However, at charging
 * stations they can fill their battery back up.
 *
 * For a given robot dog's walk return the number of
 * meters it is able to walk, assuming it charges
 * its battery back to 100% at every station.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Input:
 *     - capacity: 7
 *     - stations: [4, 9, 21, 30]
 *   Output: 16
 *
 * @param {number}        capacity The number of meters a robot dog can go with a full battery.
 * @param {Array<number>} stations Every charging station's position in meters measured from the start. (sorted ascendingly)
 *
 * @return {number} The number of meters the robot dog is able to walk before it's battery runs out.
